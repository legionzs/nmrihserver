// Example config for customizing weapon options.
// ============================================================================
//
// Customizable weapons stats:
//
//     damage                   => Normal weapon damage (including grenades) (see below for random damage range)
//                                 On medical items this means the amount of health restored
//     damage_headshot          => Head/brainstem damage
//     damage_shove             => Shove damage
//     damage_shove_headshot    => Shove damage against head/brainstem
//     damage_thrown            => Throw damage
//     damage_thrown_headshot   => Throw damage against head/brainstem
//     weight                   => Weight of weapon in inventory (item weight in wheel will look unchanged)
//     capacity                 => Magazine capacity (there is a visual limit of 254)
//     stamina_melee            => Melee attack stamina cost
//     stamina_shove            => Stamina cost of shove
//     shove_cooldown           => Number of seconds players must wait between shoves (default is 1.2 seconds)
//     can_suicide              => Allow player to suicide with weapon. Use 0 to prevent suicide and 1 to allow
//     can_skillshot            => Linux only: Allow weapon to enter skillshot mode
//     radius                   => Blast radius of grenade or flare gun
//     pushback                 => Melee weapon pushback chance (0 = never, 100 = always)
//     pushback_charged         => Chance for pushback when charged melee attack
//
// Random weapon damage:
//
//     You can enter a range as damage and the plugin will randomize the amount of
//     damage the weapon deals. For example: "damage_headshot" "400-600" will pick
//     a random amount of damage between 400 and 600 (inclusive).
//
//     This feature also works on medical items whose damage gets interpreted as its
//     heal amount.
//
// Customizable animation speeds:
//
//     For example, "reload" "1.75" makes a firearm reload 75% faster than normal.
//
//     quick            => Melee quick attack
//     charge           => Melee charge-up
//                         Grenade prime
//     release          => Melee charged release
//                         Grenade throw
//     hip_fire         => Shooting a firearm from the hip
//                         Using medical item
//                         Placing barricade
//     sight_fire       => Shooting a firearm using ironsights
//     sight            => Raising ironsight to eye
//     unsight          => Lowering ironsight from eye
//     shove            => Weapon shove
//     reload           => Reload partially full weapon
//     reload_empty     => Reload from empty
//     secondary        => Weapon's alt-attack: Chainsaw start, e-tool and barricade toggle
//     maglite_on       => Turning maglite on
//     maglite_off      => Turning maglite off
//     check_ammo      => Checking magazine
//     unload           => Unloading a weapon
//
// The animation keys listed above can be reused with a "_delay" suffix to set
// the number of seconds the animation must play before the weapon is considered
// ready to attack again. For example, "reload_delay" "0.5" will make a weapon
// able to attack 0.5 seconds after reloading.
//
// The bow is complicated: It uses "sight" speed for the portion of the attack
// animation where the bow's sights move into view. Then it uses "sight_fire"
// speed during the actual arrow release portion of the animation. Finally it
// uses the "unsight" speed for when the bow lowers away from view.
//
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Making your own weapon configs:
//
// * Create a new text file in your nmrih/addons/sourcemod/configs folder
//   named something like "myconfig.cfg"
//
// * Add a "weaponconfig" block to the text file that contains a block
//   named after each weapon you want to customize (see the examples below)
//
// * In-game, set "sm_weapon_config" through the console to the name of your
//   weapon config (excluding the .cfg extension) E.g. "sm_weapon_config myconfig"
//
//
"weaponconfig"
